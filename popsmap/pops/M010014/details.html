<p>Articulated with rectangular steel columns, the one-story, full-block arcade along the southeast side of Water Street between Wall Street and Gouverneur Lane creates a protected corridor next to the sidewalk and an entrance to the building and retail space. A strip of plaza next to Gouverneur Lane between Water and Front Streets is an empty space. A brief moment of Wall Street frontage at the corner of Wall and Water Streets secures the Wall Street address, even though the main entrance is on Water Street.
