<p>In front of a tiny arcade, the plaza on the south side of West 58th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues is fully used by a semicircular drop-off driveway and canopied entrance corridor. The flowery brick planters have spiked ledges. At a recent site visit, the space was under construction scaffolding. The plaza area in front of the West 57th Street side of the through-block building is empty. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
