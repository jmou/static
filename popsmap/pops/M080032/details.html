<p>The most distinctive component of the tiny plaza and arcade located midway between East 79th and 80th Streets on the east side of Fifth Avenue across from Central Park is The Castle (1970), a 15-foot-high welded steel sculpture by Priscilla Kapel that depicts a castle with turrets, towers, and arched entryways. Without its title, it could be thought to depict a compressed Italian hill town. As for the plaza space, it is occupied by a small semicircular drop-off driveway leading to the arcade.
