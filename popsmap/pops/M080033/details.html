<p>Unlike virtually all the neighboring residential buildings along this section of Park Avenue that have built out at ground level to their respective front lot lines and then set back, ziggurat-style, at upper floors, this tower is set back at ground level and thus able to introduce a plaza whose typology is more commonly found in front of residential towers elsewhere. At the northwest corner of Park Avenue and East 79th Street, the plaza follows the semicircular drop-off driveway model, but with a slight twist. In the half-circle area normally reserved for the ornamental fountain are artworks that render the space imageable to the public. The current sculpture, entitled Cat (1984), by Fernando Botero, is a bronze of a well-fed, polar-bear-sized cat with great whiskers. A previous sculpture, by Francisco Zunica, was a bronze of three grand women majestically strutting in different directions. Well-manicured shrubs and trees still surround the sculpture. 
<p>The space remaining around the driveway is currently filled with small trees and shrubs, but has displayed colorful flowers in the past. On Park Avenue, the plaza space is a small sunken corridor, separated from the sidewalk by a wall adorned with a small fence, heading north into the southern wall of the next building on Park Avenue. On East 80th Street west of Park Avenue is another tiny area of plaza.
