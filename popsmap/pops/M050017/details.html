<p>With its fixed benches and row of tall trees near the sidewalk edge, this narrow, rectangular plaza on the south side of West 27th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues modestly exceeds the minimal legal requirements governing “as-of-right” plazas. Individuals associated with the Fashion Institute of Technology mill about the space, enjoying this tiny front yard. The existence of amenities and the low black metal fence surrounding the space may make it appear more private, dedicated exclusively to the building’s occupants, than the average plaza, but the truth is that members of the public are free to enter the space at any time.
