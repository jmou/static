<p>The main part of the plaza is an elevated, square terrace located at the northeast corner of Second Avenue and East 58th Street, directly south of the residential tower. Gaining access requires some determination, however. From Second Avenue, the pedestrian must climb steps, go under the building, and climb up more steps to the plaza. From East 58th Street, the journey is also up steps, down a walkway, under the building, and, reversing course, up more steps. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000) 
<p>The focal point of the concrete-paved terrace is a skeletal black steel gazebo. Because it is uncovered on top and sides, its value is aesthetic rather than functional. Well-manicured landscaping in brick planters with ledge seating encircles the gazebo, and the four terrace corners are occupied by planters with more trees, shrubs, and ground cover. The overall image is precise, although the user might long for something like movable tables and chairs that allow for personalization of the space. The remainder of the plaza and an arcade wrap around the residential building along Second Avenue and the south side of East 59th Street. Some of the planter ledges here have spikes. A small portion of plaza is actually under the building edge closest to East 58th Street.
