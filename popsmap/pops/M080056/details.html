<p>Wrapping around the two street sides of the building at the northwest corner of First Avenue and East 83rd Street is this unapologetic example of a mid-1960s plaza at a residential tower. The semicircular drop-off driveway with planter in the half circle is located in front of the lobby entrance on the north side of East 83rd Street, the ramp entrance to the below-ground garage is west of the driveway, the ledges all have spiked railings, and the remaining sliver of space along the west side of First Avenue is covered with planters.
