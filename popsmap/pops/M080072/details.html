<p>Wrapping around the residential tower on the east side of York Avenue and the north side of East 80th Street are two slivers of plaza. The East 80th Street space is a sunken concrete rectangle, one floor down and accessible by ramps. Half the space is occupied by a childrenâ€™s play area, the other half is empty but for a small planter. The York Avenue sliver is six steps up, running the length of the building in front of its main entrance. Planters line the perimeter, but seating on the ledges is prevented by shrubs and small fences.
