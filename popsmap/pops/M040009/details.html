<p>Located between West 41st and 42nd Streets and Eleventh and Twelfth Avenues, east of its host building, this public open space is under construction, thus making comments on its ultimate qualities premature. Another uncertainty is its ultimate size. A 1989 restrictive declaration filed by the developer and governing development of this site states that the required size of the public open space will vary depending on how much commercial space is ultimately developed. If more than 25 percent of the development’s overall floor area is commercial, then a minimum of 30,000 square feet of public open space must be supplied. If 25 percent or less of the overall floor area is commercial, then a minimum of 21,000 square feet of public open space must be provided. Since only the construction of the development’s first building is underway, and the final project size has yet to be definitively established, the final required size of the public open space cannot be stated with certainty. The information presented in this profile, on required size, access, and amenities, is based on plans submitted by the developer to the Department of City Planning for purposes of demonstrating that the public open space would comply with provisions of the restrictive declaration. Requirements for the public open space may change in the future depending on the nature of the final development. 
<p>The triangle of space denominated “interim landscaping” is interim until another building to the east is constructed, at which time that area will be occupied by the building.
