<p>The most notable aspect of this plaza is the well-known Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lion logo on the white granite façade of the building, next to the sign “Men’s Apparel Building.” Most of the plaza is extra sidewalk wrapping around the building on the east side of Sixth Avenue and the south side of West 55th Street. At a recent site visit, tables and chairs used for a restaurant occupied part of the space on West 55th Street. No record of City approval for the use has been found. A sliver of plaza sits in front of a tiny portion of building that extends south to the northern side of West 54th Street east of Sixth Avenue. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
