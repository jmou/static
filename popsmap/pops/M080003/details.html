<p>This small, wrap-around plaza on the east side of Fifth Avenue and the north side of East 79th Street packs a surprising amount of seating into its space. Along Fifth Avenue and at the corner, four tree-filled granite planters have ledges that have been carefully subdivided into individual seating units to prevent anything other than upright sitting. Three concrete benches, located near the building on Fifth Avenue, are not similarly subdivided. The East 79th Street space is occupied principally by a drop-off driveway partially covered by a canopy.
