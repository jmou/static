<p>The front part of this tiny plaza at the Permanent Mission of the Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to the United Nations consists of 10 steps and a ramp taking the visitor up to the remaining plaza space in front of the building. A bed of roses and flowering shrubs decorates the western edge of the steps. No seating surfaces are available. The arcade exists under the pronounced building overhang. At a recent site visit, the ramp was obstructed by a chain, and a disembodied voice coming out of the speaker box stated that this was a private space. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
