<p>The main part of the plaza, extending west from the northwest corner of Third Avenue and East 29th Street, is occupied by a truncated semicircular drop-off driveway and brick planters with trees and bushes. Almost all of the planter ledges are appointed with a metal spiked railing, except for a few surfaces close to the residential buildingâ€™s entryway. The Third Avenue plaza area is extra sidewalk bordering storefronts. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
