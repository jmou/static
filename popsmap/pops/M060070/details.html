<p>No matter how small, an easily accessible plaza with functional amenities will be used. This miniature plaza on the west side of First Avenue slightly south of East 57th Street is a good example. Flanking the entrance corridor, albeit just beyond the protective reach of the overhead glass canopy, are wood benches built into white planters filled with flowers and shrubs. A bench with a more public visage on the sidewalk is almost always occupied. The odd, sunken plaza space closer to East 57th Street is entered down a stairwell leading to a floor of decorative rocks.
