<p>This plaza consists of aesthetic and functional public space. On the north side of East 83rd Street, extending east from Second Avenue, is the aesthetic portion decorating each side of the canopied front entrance to the residential building. A landscape of trees, shrubs, and colorful flowers has replaced a lawn that previously covered the ground. A silver-colored abstract sculpture rises near the northeast corner of Second Avenue and East 83rd Street. Ledges have two rows of metal spikes that prevent sitting. More landscaping is adjacent to the east side of the tower. The functional public space is also east of the tower. A pathway normally used for garbage storage also leads to a gate that provides access to a play area for children on the roof above the garage entrance. The space used to have a built-in chessboard, but now has a giant, colorful childrenâ€™s play set.
