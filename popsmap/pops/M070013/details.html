<p>A well-landscaped horseshoe-shaped drop-off driveway dominates the plaza in front of the residential tower on the south side of West 66th Street near Central Park West. In the center is a small fountain surrounded by trees, flowers, and assorted ground covers. Two sidewalks on the east and west sides follow the curve of the driveway and terminate at the building entrance, where an arcade, framed with imposing white arches, provides three stone benches and protection from the elements. Because this plaza was developed prior to adoption of the residential plaza zoning regulations, however, there is no required seating here. On West 65th Street at the back of the building is a small additional piece of plaza used as a driveway and utility area.
