<p>This plaza wraps around the residential towerâ€™s three street sides, on East 67th Street, the west side of Second Avenue, and East 68th Street. Bordered by a low brick wall and planters, the bare East 68th Street space is occasionally used for activities like throwing a baseball. High ledges necessitate a hefty lift up for sitting. The Second Avenue space is extra sidewalk, and the East 67th Street space is like the East 68th Street space, but with a slight grade change in the middle. With their front door located on the western side of the building off a through-block driveway, residents have no reason to pass through this plaza at all.
