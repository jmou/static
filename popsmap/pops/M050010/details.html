<p>Elevated eight steps above the sidewalk, this small plaza on the north side of West 56th Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway used to be a dark narrow vacant terrace sandwiched between Carnegie Mews and an adjacent building to the east. A row of lonely lampposts dotted the middle. Although the space has not yet undergone the salutary transformation experienced by 888 Seventh Avenue, a similarly sized and adjacent space visible over the wall directly north, construction scaffolding that was evident at a recent site visit suggested that something was taking place. The site visit also revealed that a well-known restaurant had placed movable tables, chairs, and umbrellas in a small rectangle bordered by small palm trees. No record of City approval for the caf√© use has been found.
