<p>It would be easy to overlook this small, two-story, unenclosed triangular covered pedestrian space, situated at the northwest corner of East 50th Street and Lexington Avenue, that provides bench seating, planters, and easy access through a glass-covered entrance and stairwell down to the subway station. The Terence Cardinal Cooke Cathedral branch of the New York Public Library is located on the mezzanine level, accessible via the subway stairs, Mondays through Fridays, from 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. An arcade lines the Lexington Avenue frontage and most of the East 50th Street side as well.
