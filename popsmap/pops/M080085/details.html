<p>This wrap-around, small, red-brick residential plaza at the northeast corner of Second Avenue and East 94th Street supplies a private niche off East 94th Street for hotel guests and passersby. Two long wooden benches are hidden from the street and from each other, on the interior sides of the perimeter planters. The bench placements deter a degree of conviviality, forcing users to fix their stares at the building lobby and wall. The planting bed has all-season shrubs and trees growing out of the plaza surface. The canopied entrance corridor at the eastern end is open to the space, guaranteeing interaction between the buildingâ€™s occupants and the plaza. The drinking fountain and bicycle parking are located at the northernmost part of the plaza on Second Avenue, as far away from the entrance as possible, but great for avenue pedestrians and bicyclists.
