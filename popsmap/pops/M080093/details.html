<p>The difference between legal and physical classifications of public space is idiosyncratically illustrated by this tiny public space on the east side of Second Avenue between East 95th and 96th Streets. According to the legally approved plans, the entire 1,500-square-foot-space is an arcade. In reality, more than half of it is an empty concrete plaza, open to the sky, in front of the building, while the rest is a concrete-arched arcade. Neither area provides any functional use to members of the public.
