<p>The plaza surrounds the three street sides of this residential building on East 89th Street, the west side of York Avenue, and East 90th Street. A drop-off driveway that is sharply angled and descending, rather than semicircular and level, is the only variation from many of the other “as-of-right” plazas on the Upper East Side that front residential buildings. Planters occupy much of the space, except for a vacant area on East 90th Street located next to the trash disposal area and service entrance. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
