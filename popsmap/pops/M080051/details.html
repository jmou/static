<p>This plaza wraps around its residential building at the southeast corner of Third Avenue and East 90th Street, presenting standard “as-of-right” plaza uses of the semicircular drop-off driveway with porte cochere on East 90th Street and extra sidewalk dotted with small planters on Third Avenue. User patterns reveal one comfortable spot for seating, on the planter ledge immediately west of the driveway that provides a ledge surface and, for one person, a back against which to lean.
