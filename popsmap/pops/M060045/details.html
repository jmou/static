<p>A small, oddly shaped plaza area on the south side of East 47th Street and a narrow, rectangular plaza strip on the north side of East 46th Street flank this residential building east of Third Avenue. The East 47th Street side serves as the building’s driveway and entrance path. The center planter has 10 trees and a spiked railing on the ledge. One user described this space as “well-kept,” looking “a little like suburbia, as close as you’re going to get in New York.” As for the spiked ledge, added the user, “Let me tell you, I would not want people sitting here. Down at the corner you can spend $1.8 million on an apartment and have bums sitting outside your door.” The fountain south of the front door and the driveway leading to East 46th Street are not part of the public space.

<p>More spiked ledges rim the planters on East 46th Street. A restaurant has placed several movable tables and chairs in the plaza outside its front door. No record of City approval for this use has been found.
