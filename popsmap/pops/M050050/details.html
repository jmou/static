<p>This ribbon of plaza wraps around the entire building on Park Avenue, East 47th Street, Lexington Avenue, and East 46th Street sides. Elevated several steps above the sidewalk along Park Avenue is an empty landing in front of a deep arcade. Ever since the intertwining metal tube sculpture that used to sway in the wind was removed, the only objects of interest here have been the two brass-colored flagpoles. On the side streets, steps navigate the grade change from Park Avenue down toward Lexington Avenue, although the Lexington space itself, largely occupied by long, narrow planters, is seven steps above the sidewalk. At a recent site visit, some of the plaza and arcade space on Lexington Avenue was rendered off-limits, hidden behind construction scaffolding, and it will be interesting to see what emerges.
