<p>Roughly 100 feet west of Third Avenue on the south side of East 58th Street is this strip of plaza, more aptly described as additional sidewalk. The Art Deco-styled fa√ßade at the building entrance, planters, and a geometric paving pattern provide small elements of interest. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
