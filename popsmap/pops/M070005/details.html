<p>In essence extra sidewalk, the plaza wraps around the full blockfront residential building on three sides, from West 78th Street to the west side of Amsterdam Avenue to West 79th Street. Tree-filled planters, some with spikes on their ledges, dot the space. A glass-enclosed caf√© occupies part of the plaza at the northwest corner of Amsterdam Avenue and West 78th Street. No record of City approval for such use has been found. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
