<p>Located at the northwest corner of East End Avenue and East 82nd Street, this plaza features one of the more elegant semicircular drop-off driveways to grace a public space. Stylish touches, from the exquisite landscaping to the stone entrance piers holding oversized black lamps to the taxi light, convey refinement. The open area along East 82nd Street is covered by additional landscaping. 
<p>The perplexing part of the plaza is elsewhere, a finger extending from the north side of the building to East 83rd Street over the rooftop of a garage. At a recent site visit, whatever space there was, if any, was located behind a tall brick wall on East 83rd Street. No record of City approval removing this space from the plaza here has been found.
