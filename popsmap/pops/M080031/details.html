<p>Like its neighbor to the north at 1385 York Avenue, this plaza wraps around the three street sides of its elegant residential tower while providing almost no accessible, usable space for members of the public. It combines luxurious landscaping on East 72nd and 73rd Streets and a formal semicircular drop-off driveway with porte cochere, fountain, pool, and more landscaping in front of the building entrance on the west side of York Avenue between East 72nd and 73rd Streets. A small elevated area steps above the sidewalk is located on East 72nd Street near the garage entry driveway. For a fuller discussion of the issues raised by heavily landscaped “as-of-right” plazas, see the profile of the Churchill. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
