<p>This plaza surrounds the residential towerâ€™s three street sides, on East 73rd Street, the west side of York Avenue, and East 74th Street. Like the plaza at the Somerset one block south, showcase landscaping and a semicircular drop-off driveway with fountain and pool occupy every square foot. Spaces such as these can only be justified on the basis of visual benefit, since they are not physically accessible to any public. Driveways and loading areas ceased being counted as bonusable plaza space, but only after plazas like those at the Stratford and Somerset had been built. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
