<p>Several steps above the street, this U-shaped concrete plaza grips street and nonstreet sides of the building. From East 8th Street, a canopied corridor cuts through the space to the buildingâ€™s front door. In an area that reads as more public, along the east side of Mercer Street, a small, round fountain encircled by an unsittable slanted ledge sprays water out of and around dark sculptural elements. Planters line the perimeter and, with small concrete planters, display trees, flowers, and shrubs. At a recent site visit, the southernmost nonstreet portion of the space was closed to the public for construction. The large arcade is not part of the public space.
