<p>Although the building is called the Future, there is nothing especially futuristic about how this residential plaza deploys such old-fashioned ideas as quality materials, functional amenities, and discernible maintenance to produce an estimable result. Located at the southeast corner of Third Avenue and East 32nd Street, this clamshell-shaped space resolutely breaks away from standard angular geometries of corner plazas by curving almost everything it can. The 90-degree angle of the street intersection is softened by the sinuous sweep of several steps that navigate the grade change up to the plaza level, an open piazza unfolding to the south in front of the residential tower. Granite benches curl around five volcano-shaped brick planters in counter-rhythm to the swirling cut-stone paving pattern. More granite benches at the eastern side protrude in semicircles from planters filled with trees, shrubs, and flowers. 
<p>Although a dedicated corridor leads from Third Avenue to the tower entrance, residents see and pass through the space as if it were their front yard. Given evidence of their use of the space along with members of the public, it clearly is. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
