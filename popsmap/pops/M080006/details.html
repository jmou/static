<p>This plaza envelops two sides of this residential building, around the southeast corner of Park Avenue and East 71st Street. The primary entrance to the space is from Park Avenue, underneath the black projecting canopy that also serves as the entryway to the arcade and private lobby. On East 71st Street, a tiny pathway also permits entry, although a sign proclaims “private walk” and “no trespassing.” Almost all of the plaza is dedicated to fenced-in landscaping of trees, shrubs, and flowers that is effective visual foreground for the building, but not accessible to the public. To the south of the building is the only usable area, a narrow strip paved in white in which wood railroad-tie retaining walls at back provide a seating surface. Unfortunately, this area is not part of the public space.
