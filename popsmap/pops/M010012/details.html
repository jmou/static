<p>Rimmed by chunky, black polished stone columns, this arcade along the northeast side of Wall Street and the southeast side of Front Street may be connected with the neighboring arcade at 100 Wall Street to the northwest across the street to form a one-and-a-half block covered pedestrian passage.
