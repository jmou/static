<p>What was once a tiny, empty plaza in a recessed area of the building on the west side of Washington Street between Rector and Carlisle Streets is now home to a one-story metal building extension housing a City police station. Further exploration of this use is underway at the time of this writing. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
