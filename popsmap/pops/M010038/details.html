<p>Located on the northeast side of the intersection of Cedar and William Streets, this urban plaza at the hotel-residential tower is under construction.Â In addition to the customary array of amenities required under the urban plaza zoning standards, the owners have obtained City approval for an open air cafe next to the ground-floor hotel portion of the building.
