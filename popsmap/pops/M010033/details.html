<p>Immediately adjacent to 180 Water Street to the northeast, this building has a small entrance arcade on the north side of Water Street, a long strip of empty plaza sunken two steps below the public sidewalk on the east side of Fletcher Street, and both plaza and arcade on the south side of Pearl Street. At recent site visits, parts of the Pearl Street plaza and arcade space were rendered off-limits to the public by a low metal fence, and cars were parked in the arcade. No record of City approval for such actions and uses has been found. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
