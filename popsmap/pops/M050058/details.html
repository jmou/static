<p>This strip of plaza is located on the south side of East 43rd Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues in front of a bank office. Built-in planters with ground-hugging ledges occupy much of the space. A large metal canopy extends over a portion of it, while a driveway runs through the western edge.
