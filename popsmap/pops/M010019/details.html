<p>About 10 feet wide and defined by rectangular columns, the arcade wraps around the two street sides of the building on the east side of Broad Street and the north side of Beaver Street. At a recent site visit, café tables and chairs were used by adjacent cafés in both Broad and Beaver Street portions of the arcade. No record of City approval for such uses has been found.
