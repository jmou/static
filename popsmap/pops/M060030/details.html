<p>Encircling the three street sides of this office tower occupying the west side blockfront of Third Avenue between East 49th and 50th Streets is this bare plaza, typologically no more than extra sidewalk. Even the 15 planters that used to be here have disappeared. A small rectangular arcade shelters the area in front of the primary entrance on Third Avenue. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
