<p>This sunny residential plaza locates its primary space at the northwest corner of Lexington Avenue and East 24th Street. From the sidewalk, the space is only partly visible, substantially hidden behind planters overflowing with a variety of mature trees, shrubs, and groundcover. Three openings on East 24th Street and one from Lexington Avenue provide access. Inside, five locations of wooden benches nestled along variously shaped brick planters satisfy the range of user preferences for sunny, shady, public, or semi-public experiences. Indeed, for such a small space, the diversity of experience is unusual. Along Lexington Avenue, a canopy and a row of small movable planters define the residential entrance corridor, although it is possible to go from the corridor directly into the space.
