<p>Located on the west side of Vanderbilt Avenue between East 46th and 47th Streets and the south side of East 47th Street between Vanderbilt and Madison Avenues, primarily inside the new world headquarters building for the large financial firm Bear Stearns, these four spaces together will afford the street-level pedestrian an easier, more pleasant way to connect into the lower-level world of Grand Central Terminal from this part of Manhattan. The spaces include two areas of building entrance recess area at building corners, and a through block connection and off-street rail mass transit access improvement that create an L-shaped indoor walkway around the building and furnish escalators leading to the below-ground New North End Access to 47th Street Cross Passageway. This building joins Philip Morris as the second office development to take advantage of unused development rights above Grand Central Terminal. Further comment on these spaces will await their completion.
