<p>Three small notches cut into this office tower, on West 43rd Street, the west side of Sixth Avenue, and West 44th Street, provide space for this plaza. The tiny area on Sixth Avenue has two planters with downward-sloping ledges that make seating difficult. Leaning is possible, however, against the taller of the two planters. At a recent site visit, a restaurant had located tables and chairs in the plaza area on West 44th Street. No record of City approval for this use has been found. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
