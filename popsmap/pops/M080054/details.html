<p>The plaza surrounds the building on almost all of its three street sides of East 80th Street, the west side of First Avenue, and East 81st Street. The best part of the space is probably only known to building residents: a small lawn hidden from the street by its higher grade level and well-trimmed hedges at the northwest corner of First Avenue and East 80th Street. Access is available up the canopied stairwell leading to the buildingâ€™s front entrance. Although structured seating is not available, the lawn itself is flat, sunny, and pleasant. A smaller lawn is located west of the entrance. The rest of the space includes a sunken rectangular plaza strip on First Avenue in front of retail outlets. A strip of plaza should be located on East 81st Street.
