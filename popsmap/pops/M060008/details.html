<p>A strip of plaza, partly covered by a projecting overhang, girdles this residential building along East 34th Street, the west side of Lexington Avenue, and East 35th Street. Landscaped brick planters make the space largely inaccessible, and the otherwise sittable ledges next to the public sidewalk are crowned with two rows of black spiked railings. Photo: Kayden et al.
