<p>The plaza wraps around the street sides of this residential building at the northeast corner of Second Avenue and East 87th Street. The only accessible space is a sunken, concrete-paved, empty rectangular strip in front of below-grade retail stores on Second Avenue. Stairwells at north and south ends, as well as a ramp from the sidewalk at the north end, provide access. The plaza space on East 87th Street is covered by grass behind large brick-walled planters that flank the stairwell leading up to the front door. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
