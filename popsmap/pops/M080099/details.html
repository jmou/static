<p>This plaza wraps around almost all of the buildingâ€™s street frontages on East 59th Street, the west side of Lexington Avenue, and East 60th Street. On the avenue, the space is extra sidewalk, demarcated by distinctive paving pattern, in front of cylindrical bubble-windowed retail stores. Miniscule ledges near the base of the windows are used for brief sitting. On the side streets, the space is empty but for stairwells down to the subway below, more miniscule ledges that are minimally sittable, and, on East 60th Street, a garage entrance and two spaces for bicycle parking.
