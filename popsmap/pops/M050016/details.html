<p>Five steps above the south side of East 57th Street slightly west of Park Avenue, the main part of the plaza is a narrow, deep patio at the back of its host building that has enjoyed great popularity at lunchtime. Sculpted green plastic café chairs, black metal benches, planter ledges, and the steps at the perimeter are typically filled. A café at the rear has supplied food. Although the pool and fountain are no longer present, planters filled with flowers and trees still foster an ambiance suited for hot summer days. No record of the City approval for removal of the water feature has been located. The rest of the plaza space is a sliver of extra sidewalk running east to Park Avenue. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
