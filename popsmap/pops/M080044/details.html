<p>Designed shortly after the City adopted in 1977 the new and more demanding rules for plazas located at residential buildings, this residential plaza still illustrates the beginning, rather than the end, of the learning curve. Located at the southwest corner of Third Avenue and East 95th Street, the primary space relies heavily on concrete or concretelike materials for floor, planter wall, and planter ledge surfaces, materials that demand maintenance and repair over time as evidenced by the current conditions here. The landscape of small bushes and occasional trees is sparse and would benefit greatly from an undercoating of groundcover. At a recent site visit, planter ledges were mostly trimmed with metal spikes, metal trash dumpsters blocked one of the entries to the space on East 95th Street, the wall artwork was not apparent, and the bicycle rack, drinking fountain, and plaque were missing. No record of City approval for such lapses has been found. The Third Avenue usable residual space is extra sidewalk with several planters and spiked ledges. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
