<p>This multistory, open-air covered pedestrian space, the first covered pedestrian space built under the covered pedestrian space bonus provisions of the Zoning Resolution, is essentially a through-block arcade with retail frontage running northeast from the intersection of William and Platt Streets to John Street. The flashy chrome columns and stage lighting evoke a theatrical air that reminds users of the Broadway theater discount ticket outlet that once occupied the lower level. The escalators still work but now lead to a service retail use at the bottom. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
