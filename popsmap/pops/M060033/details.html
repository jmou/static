<p>This sidewalk widening has the singular virtue of satisfying “truth in advertising.” Unlike the many plazas, produced years ago under the lenient 1961 Zoning Resolution’s “as-of-right” plaza definition, which look like widened sidewalks but are legally bonused as plazas, this public space is legally classified and bonused as a sidewalk widening. It expands the public sidewalk along the west side of Third Avenue and the north side of East 54th Street in front of this sleek office tower, whose one-column arcade and design are vaguely suggestive of Citigroup Center one block south.
