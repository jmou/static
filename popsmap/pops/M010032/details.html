<p>This plaza wraps around three of four street sides of this full-block building, on State Street, the north side of Pearl Street, and Whitehall Street. Several steps above the sidewalk, both Pearl and Whitehall Street areas have planters, with the best sittable ledges on Whitehall Street near the steps. At a recent site visit, a caf√© on the State Street side had placed tables and chairs on the plaza. No record of City approval for this use has been found. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
