<p>Wrapping around the northeast corner of First Avenue and East 84th Street is this sliver of public space labeled an open plaza by the Cityâ€™s special permit. Four planters filled with sprays of colorful flowers mark the dividing line between public sidewalk and the space. Planter ledges along First Avenue are sittable. The arcade at the building is not part of the required public space. Although the open plaza did not generate a floor area bonus, the developer did obtain bonus floor area by agreeing to provide 12 lampposts on both sides of East 84th Street between York and First Avenues. The lampposts were missing at a recent site visit, and no record of City approval for this absence has been found.
