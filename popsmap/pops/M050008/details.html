<p>The smooth curves of the 9 mimic the building, designed by the Skidmore, Owings & Merrill architect Gordon Bunshaft, which swoops down in a ski-slope curve that overhangs the wide arcade. One of two Bunshaft designs in the city to feature a curvilinear black glass curtain wall punctuated by travertine marble columns (the other is the Grace building), on the north side of West 42nd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, across from Bryant Park), the form fascinates observers who crane their necks to study it. A black seating ledge with room for about 10 people encircles the entrance escalators leading to a lower level under the arcade. 
<p>The most usable plaza space is at the back of the building on West 58th Street, west of the entrance. Here, a slightly elevated rectangular terrace paved with gravel furnishes movable tables and chairs, accessed across a small bridge spanning a moatlike pool dotted with four fountains. A lattice masks the back wall of an adjacent building. At a recent site visit, the plaza was rendered off-limits by construction work that may or may not include revisions to the space. A strip of plaza and arcade that essentially mirrors the West 57th Street layout, along with ledge seating, is located along the West 58th Street sidewalk further east. The owner of the building, an avid art collector, has installed a Joan Mir√≥ sculpture in the plaza area closest to Fifth Avenue.
