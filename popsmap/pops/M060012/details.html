<p>Wrapping around the street faces of this residential building from the southeast corner of Third Avenue and East 24th Street is this small strip of plaza. Low planters with ledges sporting a decorative, spiked railing border much of the space. On a sunny day, residents supply their own chairs and sit in front of the planters. A recent site visit disclosed gates on both Third Avenue and East 24th Street, separating the public sidewalk from the accessible space. No record of City approval for these gates has been found.
