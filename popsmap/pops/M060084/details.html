<p>At a recent site visit, this deep, dark variance arcade extending eastward from the southeast corner of Lexington Avenue and East 37th Street stored empty concrete planters beneath its multiple rows of stark columns. No uses are conceivable, and a posted list of rules prohibits anything else, including loitering, sleeping, occupying a bench or table for long periods, camping, or defecating. The image of this arcade dramatically illustrates the distance that sometimes exists between aspirational theory and empirical reality of public space. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
