<p>The large, open garden with an impressive water feature located behind a fence and locked gate west of the building is not the public space here. Even the semicircular drop-off driveway is not part of the public space. Instead, it is the garage entrance driveway that constitutes the plaza, whose eastern boundary is parallel to the eastern edge of the building, discernible deeper into the lot to the south.
