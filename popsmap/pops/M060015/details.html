<p>This is another plaza that clamps around the three street sides of its full blockfront building, on the east side of Third Avenue between East 32nd and 33 rd Streets. Cross-hatched with black handrails, the block-long staircase of 10 steps cascades down from the Third Avenue sidewalk into a bare rectangular strip in front of below-grade storefronts. Surfaces that could be used for seating along the avenue have rows of black metal spiked rails. The empty spaces on East 32nd and 33rd Streets balance each other out: the southern space is elevated, the northern space is sunken. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
