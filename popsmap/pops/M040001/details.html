<p>Narrow, rectangular outcroppings of elevated, terracelike plaza flank the West 58th and 57th Street entrances to this through-block office building between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues. Eight wood benches supported on each side by tiny tree-filled planters are located on the West 58th Street terraces, while the West 57th Street terraces provide ledges that may be minimally used for seating at their perimeters. A recently added truncated glass-enclosed pyramid used by an automobile showroom occupies non-public space at the northeast corner of Eleventh Avenue and West 57th Street, but the new automobiles that, at a recent site visit, were displayed in the eastern portion of the arcade on West 57th Street should have been quickly driven out of that public space. More arcade space, mostly used as a loading zone for trucks, is found at much of the Eleventh Avenue and all of the West 58th Street building frontages.
