<p>The primary space of this residential plaza is located west of the building, two steps up from the sidewalk and behind swinging white gates on the north side of East 79th Street between East End and First Avenues. The plaza is divided into contrasting outdoor rooms: an open, sunny front room and a confined, darker rear room. The front room sometimes becomes so drenched in sunlight that it appears washed out. Mostly out of the sunâ€™s reach, the back room is crowded by the placement of a square planter with four trees in its middle. Both areas have plentiful fixed bench seating. Further north is visual residual space filled with landscaping. A sign that used to prohibit only ball playing has been updated to include skateboarding and rollerblading. The public space plaque on the brick wall east of the entrance is obscured by shrubs. 
<p>Usable residual space occupies the front of the building, with planters flanking both sides of the canopied entrance. The remaining visual residual space east of the building is hardly visible behind the tall wire fence.
