<p>This small urban plaza at the northwest corner of Sixth Avenue and West 44th Street proves that even modest gestures are appreciated by members of the public. The seating ledges around the two planters are fully occupied much of the day, by users seeking the sun and shade that alternately brush the space. The planter seats nearest the corner receive the most sun, the planter seats to the west are shadier. If it starts to rain, a short stretch of adjacent arcade is available. The sidewalk widening wraps around the Sixth Avenue and West 45th Street sides of the building. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
