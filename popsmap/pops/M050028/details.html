<p>This plaza is extra sidewalk that stretches along the building’s frontage on the north side of West 53rd Street, the east side of Broadway, and the south side of West 54th Street. At a recent site visit, an open air café fringed with palm trees operated in the space along West 53rd Street, and a small area of table and chairs was established next to the building on Broadway. No record of City approval for such uses has been found. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
