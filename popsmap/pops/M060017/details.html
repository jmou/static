<p>The main part of this rectangular plaza is west of the hotel, on the south side of East 39th Street immediately east of the Midtown Tunnel Access Road between Second and Third Avenues. This intimate space is sheltered by a three-foot-high iron-grill fence along East 39th Street and an undulating, landscaped planter border along the access road. During the warmer months of the year, the space is filled with metal caf√© tables and chairs next to the restaurant. Were the restaurant to use these tables and chairs for its private operation, it would need City approval. Decorative park lamps arise out of the landscaping to the west, while a European-style ornamental fountain featuring three horn-blowing cherubs and a figure holding a fish decorate the rear. The remainder of the plaza space is a small drop-off driveway partly beneath a canopy located in front of the hotel entrance on East 39th Street. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
