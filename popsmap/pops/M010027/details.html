<p>The plaza is an extension to the sidewalk on the east side of Broad Street, next to the arcade, as well as patches along the south side of Water Street, several steps above that sidewalk. Seating is confined to the steps and a small granite ledge abutting colorful flowers and shrubs on Water Street. The paving material matches the building skin, making space and structure appear as part of a single design gesture, punctuated by a quaint, three-sided clock attached to the building at the corner of Broad and Water Streets. To the east of the building is the Vietnam Veterans Plaza next to 55 Water Streetâ€™s plaza. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
