<p>The plaza is little more than an addition to the public sidewalk that stretches around the building’s three street sides of State Street, the east side of Whitehall Street, and Pearl Street. A planter with several trees and shrubs supplies ledge seating near the tiny inset arcade at the building’s main entrance on Whitehall Street. Interestingly, the Whitehall Street public sidewalk is a well-landscaped, tree-lined walkway.
