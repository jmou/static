<p>Mature trees and shrubs in white-walled planters cover much of this rectangular residential plaza located west of Broadway and the building on the south side of West 55th Street. The recessed gate may give the impression that the space is not open to the public, and in the past the gate has been locked when it should have been open. The planters create an angular pathway from front to back, where a dumpster near the service entrance is located. Seating is provided on the thin planter ledges, although the ledge outside the gate has a spiked railing. The strip of residential plaza between the primary space and Broadway has a squeezed, semicircular drop-off driveway. 
<p>The City and owner currently disagree about the nature and obligations of this space. The owner has told the City that the space is not a residential plaza at all, since, it argues, construction of the building commenced prior to the effective date of the 1977 Zoning Resolutionâ€™s residential plaza provisions. Based on available evidence, the City has concluded that the residential plaza standards did, indeed, apply to this space. The owner has agreed to provide the amenities listed below, and the City and owner will be having further discussions to resolve this issue.
