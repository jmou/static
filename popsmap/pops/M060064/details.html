<p>This miniscule plaza wraps around the residential tower on the east side of Second Avenue and the north side of East 45th Street. Along East 45th Street, it is extra sidewalk, while on Second Avenue, it expands the sidewalk for only part of the frontage. Surprisingly, the arcade on East 45th Street is not a public space.
