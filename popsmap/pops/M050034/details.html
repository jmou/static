<p>Steps above the east side of Park Avenue and spanning the entire blockfront from East 51st to 52nd Street is this plain, half-acre slab of plaza. The bulk of the space is on Park Avenue, interrupted by a small sunken square area with fixed benches and ledge seating. Tree-filled planters and inward-facing benches line the space extending east on East 51st Street. The street-facing ledge provides seating, with fine views to the south of Saint Bartholemewâ€™s Cathedral. Near the back is a 12-foot-high bronze sculpture entitled Dinoceras (1971), by Robert Cook, an evocation of an animal that roamed North America during the Eocene age, or perhaps a marriage of dinosaur and rhinoceros.
