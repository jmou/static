<p>The plaza is divided into tiny spaces on West 57th and 58th Street frontages of this through-block residential building halfway between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. The rectangular patch on West 57th Street sits in front of the building entrance, topped by canopy and flanked by three trees on each side. The sliver on West 58th Street has brick-walled planters with trees at its perimeter that are lined with metal spikes to prevent sitting.
