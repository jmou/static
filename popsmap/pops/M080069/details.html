<p>This U-shaped plaza displays several commonplace public space uses. On the west side of York Avenue between East 88th and 89th Streets, an elegant semicircular drop-off driveway with fountain and pool in the half circle is flanked on both sides by two large fully landscaped areas featuring trees, shrubs, and lawn. Low perimeter walls along the sidewalk are lined with shrubs and a tiny metal fence that render sitting on the ledge impossible. In short, like many other “as-of-right” plazas created for residential buildings under the original 1961 Zoning Regulations, the space perfectly serves the functional and aesthetic needs of its host building.
