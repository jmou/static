<p>Wrapping around the southeast corner of Third Avenue and East 62nd Street, this plaza along its commercial frontage on Third Avenue is extra sidewalk interspersed with four planters, trimmed with spiked ledges, and scattered lampposts. An articulated fa√ßade with decorative elements on the second floor above the stores creates interest. At a recent site visit, movable tables and chairs used by a coffee shop were placed near the southern edge on Third Avenue close to East 61st Street, for which no record of City approval has been found. On East 62nd Street is a semicircular drop-off driveway, in front of a small entrance arcade. More planters with spiked ledges occupy the leftover space around the driveway.
