<p>This indoor through block connection is the westernmost of three parallel mid-block passageways linking West 56th and 57th Streets between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, along with the spaces at Metropolitan Tower and Le Parker Meridien Hotel. Like most through block connections, this one is designed for pedestrian flows rather than pedestrian pauses. Sleek lines move people along. Under the glow of the ribbed and vaulted translucent ceiling, light reflections dance on the abundant brass accents and polished surfaces of red and black marble. Thankfully, the floor material for the first several feet of corridor has been scored to give entering pedestrians greater traction on rainy or snowy days. No seats are provided anywhere along the corridor. The space also serves as a lobby for office tenants, with elevators on both sides and a guard desk. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
