<p>Floating between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue and West 69th and 70th Streets, this small, triangular island lot is bisected at its northern end by a tiny east-west passthrough plaza. The space is framed at each entrance by trusslike structures spanning above and connecting a bank office branch to the residential tower. In its middle is a large, round brick planter filled with trees. Two additional planters normally decorated with colorful spring and summer annuals flank the residential entrance, while a single planter masks the back of the bank outpost to the north. All planters have ledges frequently used for seating. The strip of plaza on West 69th Street has four brick planters.
