<p>Unenclosed at both ends, this skylit, glass-covered through block galleria connecting West 52nd and 53rd Streets is the second link in the six-block chain of through block privately owned public spaces running from West 51st to 57th Streets between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. Unlike legally defined through block connection spaces that are effectively required to be provided by the developer to satisfy its pedestrian circulation space requirements without a zoning bonus, and are expressly designed to serve the singular purpose of circulation, through block gallerias are provided in exchange for a floor area bonus and have supplemental callings, including, for example, the furnishing of public seating. 
<p>At recent site visits, the space has fallen short on both callings. The seating provided, including a wooden bench near the West 52nd Street entrance, appears to be less than the 185.75 linear feet required. During the specified hours of access, the gates were locked. No record of City approval for these variations has been found. At least the eastern wall is leavened with several small recessed areas filled with shrubs. 
<p>The five other spaces in the six-block alternative pedestrian network include the through block galleria at PaineWebber to the south, and the through block galleria at 1325 Avenue of the Americas, the through block connection at Rihga Royal Hotel, the through block connection at CitySpire, and the through block connection at Metropolitan Tower.
