<p>The brass-colored gates at the entrance to this residential plaza on the north side of East 68th Street east of Third Avenue are the best clue that this is a Trump space, in accord with the developerâ€™s public embrace of brass appointments. Inside, the square plaza is large and uncomplicated. A substantial planter occupies the center, with colorful flowers, plants, and four corner trees, encircled by backed granite benches. Planters with mature overhanging trees and more granite benches line east and west sides of the space. With plentiful sunlight and abundant seating, users are usually able to customize their public space experience for sun or shade during much of the day. 
<p>Situated at the back of Trump Palace, with service entry and trash bin but no true secondary residential entrance, the plaza feels detached from its host tower. Natural opportunities for contact between members of the public and the community of private residents are lost. Thus, it is interesting to compare the qualities of this space with another Trump-developed residential plaza, at Trump Plaza, that by design commingles residents and members of the public to the evident advantage of both.
