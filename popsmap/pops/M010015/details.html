<p>This U-shaped plaza grips the full-block office building on three of its four street frontages, along Front Street, Gouverneur Lane, and South Street, leaving the Wall Street frontage to an arcade connecting two of the plaza areas. The most usable portion of the plaza is on Front Street, where circular planters on the two-toned surface intervene among 25 fixed gray steel benches, dividing the larger space into comfortable nooks and crannies better suited to private conversations and lunch breaks. In past years, movable red plastic benches have supplemented the fixed seating. Bike racks abut the building corner at Front Street and Gouverneur Lane. The plaza sliver on South Street enjoys a pleasant view under the F.D.R. Drive and across the East River to Brooklyn. Movable benches and planters have been provided here in the past. Since this plaza was produced under the “as-of-right” plaza provisions of the 1961 Zoning Resolution, none of the provided amenities is required. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
