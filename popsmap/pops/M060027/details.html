<p>These lean public spaces are located in front of the East 44th and 45th Street entrances to this office tower, mid-block between Third and Lexington Avenues. A diminutive rectangular urban plaza on East 44th Street fills the tower setback space, and features a round, brick, flower-filled planter with seating ledge. A loading dock provides occasional interest to the east. At a recent site visit, the three movable chairs were not in evidence. Immediately north, a three-story-high arcade covers the entrance to the private through-block lobby. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000) 
<p>On the East 45th Street side of the building is more arcade space made interesting only because physical and legal typologies diverge: part of the arcade is under the building, as a physical arcade space is meant to be, but part of it is instead under a canopy, as only a legal arcade might be. The sidewalk widening completes the public spaces here. Tiny dish planters holding bushes and ivy are scattered about.
