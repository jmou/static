<p>Set back from its two street sides at the northeast corner of Park Avenue and East 87th Street, the building creates space for a sliver of plaza adjacent to a parallel arcade that is almost as large as the plaza. The plaza is lined at its border by large and small planters positioned side by side such that access to the space is rendered difficult. Indeed, entry is obtained only under the green canopy from Park Avenue or through a gate and up several steps off East 87th Street.
