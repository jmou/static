<p>The main plaza space, on the south side of East 60th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues, accommodates a semicircular drop-off driveway and pedestrian pathways to the main entrance of the residential tower. Between the public sidewalk and driveway is a large fountain and pool. The ledge along East 60th Street is not sittable. Along East 59th Street on the southern side of the building is a strip of plaza that functions as extra sidewalk. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
