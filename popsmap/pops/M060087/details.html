<p>Although the tiny plaza space located in front of the building on the south side of East 58th Street between Sutton Place South and First Avenue is easy to overlook, it has the virtue of existing as public space. According to available legal documents, additional plaza space takes the form of a narrow finger connecting the public sidewalk on East 57th Street northward to the back of the New Yorker East. However, that space is currently occupied by a single-story, permanent, private entrance structure called a greenhouse. The City and owner have entered into preliminary discussions about the legal basis for this greenhouse. Members of the public should consult the New York City Privately Owned Public Space Database, described more fully in Chapter 4, for updated information about this situation. Photo: Kayden et al.
