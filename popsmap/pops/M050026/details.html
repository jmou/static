<p>This elevated strip of plaza wraps around the three street frontages of this full blockfront building on the east side of Sixth Avenue, West 53rd Street, and West 54th Street. Much of it is taken over by two sets of steps that serve as casual seating, especially at the southeast corner of West 54th Street and Sixth Avenue. At a recent site visit, a performer entertained a crowd gathered at the northeast corner of West 53rd Street and Sixth Avenue, demonstrating that even marginal spaces can serve as platforms for civic enjoyment and engagement.
