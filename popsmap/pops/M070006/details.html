<p>Although there is extensive open space west of this residential tower that looks like privately owned public space even to the trained eye, the legally required plaza is only the extra strip of sidewalk encircling the three street sides of the building along West 70th Street, the west side of Amsterdam Avenue, and West 71st Street.
