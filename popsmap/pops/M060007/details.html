<p>This plaza is extremely easy to overlook. On the north side of East 34th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues is a narrow, bare strip, bordered by six lampposts, at slightly different grade levels from the public sidewalk. A branch of the post office provides the only reason to cross the space. At the eastern tip is a tiny landing seven steps up, with no conceivable use to which it might be put. At a recent site visit, a locked gate obstructed access to that landing, and no record of City approval for the locked gate has been found. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
