<p>Wide and shallow, this simple urban plaza on the north side of East 55th Street slightly west of Park Avenue is announced by a lineup of street trees in front of it. The space sits in the setback area in front of the through-block Park Avenue Tower, and features six polished granite planters, three on eastern and western walls, extending toward the center. As with other spaces displaying similar planter layouts, for example a one-sided layout is at 425 Lexington Avenue, users are able to choose between public and less public seating along the planter ledges. Two additional benches are located at northeast and northwest corners. Uniform design elements tie together surface, planter, and surrounding walls, almost to the point where an interruption of diverse retail frontage might be welcome.
