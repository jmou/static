<p>This sliver of plaza elevated four steps above the public sidewalk on the south side of West 56th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues is occupied by bushes and concrete planters with trees. A metal railing with ornamental spikes adorns the brick wall parallel to the sidewalk and prevents sitting. Accessible only by stairwell and not open and accessible to the sidewalk along its full frontage, the arcade displays a small abstract sculpture.
