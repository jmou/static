<p>Under construction at the time of this writing, this tiny residential plaza along the north side of East 34th Street immediately east of Lexington Avenue was one of the first required to be certified by the Chairperson of the City Planning Commission as complying with the requirements of the Zoning Resolution. This change in administrative review procedure was adopted by zoning amendment in 1996. Previously, residential plazas were provided “as-of-right,” with review conducted by examiners from the Department of Buildings. Further comments on this space will await its completion.
