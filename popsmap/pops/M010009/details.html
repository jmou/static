<p>The plaza is a ribbon of space that wraps around virtually all of the buildingâ€™s three street frontages on Water, John, and Pearl Streets. An arcade protects the lobby entrance on John Street. Plaza and arcade at the immediately adjacent office building, 160 Water Street, to the southwest, are not part of the public space at 180 Water Street. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
