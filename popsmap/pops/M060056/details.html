<p>Functionally extra sidewalk, this plaza is located in front of the opaque façade of the United States Post Office’s Franklin D. Roosevelt station, on the eastern blockfront of Third Avenue between East 54th and 55th Streets. A painted aluminum sculpture entitled Red Flying Group (1973-1987), by Ann Gillen, creates the only moment of interest. A U-shaped arcade extends around the building on Third Avenue and the side streets. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
