<p>Four steps below the sidewalk, this rectangular plaza extends north from the northeast corner of East 33rd Street and Second Avenue. Fixed concrete seating discs emerge mushroomlike from the purplish brick-and-concrete paving. Stackable plastic tables and chairs are positioned in front of the pizza/pasta shop and may be used by members of the public without obligation to purchase. Rimmed by narrow ledges with tiny decorative metal fences, four small concrete planters containing bushes and groundcover vie to fulfill a requirement set forth in the restrictive declaration filed by the building’s owner that the plaza will be a “landscaped pedestrian space.” The arcade wraps around the corner of Second Avenue and East 34th Street. Its easternmost portion on East 34th Street has been occupied by a private spa use at a recent site visit. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
