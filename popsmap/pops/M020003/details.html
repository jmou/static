<p>Since this full-block office building covers almost the entire zoning lot, its 13,000 square feet of plaza is necessarily extruded into a long ribbon wrapping around its four sides on Hudson, West Houston, Greenwich, and King Streets. As such, the space functions as an extension of the public sidewalk. At a recent site visit, several caf√© chairs were placed in the plaza outside a food outlet and next to the outdoor arcade on West Houston Street. No record of City approval for the chairs has been found. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000) 
<p>Two Frank Stella artworks on north and south sides of the private lobby off Hudson Street are vaguely visible from the plaza and sidewalk. It is interesting to contrast their placement in this lobby with the placement of another Stella in the private lobby at 599 Lexington Avenue. That Stella boldly engages pedestrians in the public space outside the building as well as those who enter the lobby.
