<p>Midway between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue on the south side of West 67th Street, this planter-filled strip of plaza contains virtually no usable space. Access to a dark, brick-columned arcade is available only under the canopy that leads to the residential entrance or by a narrow pathway to the west that is sometimes obstructed by a locked gate. A small, interior private garden may be glimpsed beyond the residential lobby.
