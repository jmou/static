<p>Although the open space behind the golden gate and its spear-shaped finials west of the Stanford is tantalizing, the plaza only includes the strip of extra sidewalk in front of the gate and the building, on the north side of East 25th Street between Madison and Park Avenues. Bisected by the golden gate, a brick planter ledge on the street side is available for seating.
