<p>This immense plaza is a raised terrace encircling the majority of this full-block office building bounded by Water, Broad, South, and Whitehall Streets. The most usable portions are on Water Street, where ledges attached to several elliptical planters interrupt the steps and provide seating, and on South Street, where one long planter offers a sittable ledge and a pleasant view of the landmarked Battery Maritime building. Defined by rectangular black columns, the arcade fronts most of the plaza other than the South Street side. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
