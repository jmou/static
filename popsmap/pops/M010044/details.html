<p>In this pedestrian-congested area of Broadway, the fact that this plaza widens the sidewalk along the new addition to the old Irving Trust building, and is felicitously matched to it in materials and proportion, would itself be enough to merit praise, but the space exceeds that judgment by also providing subtle points of functionality. As it descends from Broadway to New Street, for example, on the north side of Exchange Place, the linear strip positions five squeezed, parallelogram-shaped polished granite planters, filled with trees, tropical plants, and flowers, along its public sidewalk perimeter. While narrow, the sittable planter ledges are frequently occupied by pedestrians making a brief stop. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000) 
<p>The strip of plaza on Broadway affords a dramatic view of Trinity Church for those who stop rushing long enough to look up from the pavement. Unfortunately, the lone planter at the northern end has a downward sloping ledge that precludes sitting.
