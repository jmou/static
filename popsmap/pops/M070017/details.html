<p>This plaza perfectly complements the curvilinear, brutalist architecture of its host building. Concrete abounds. The entry to the spaceâ€™s elevated portion, some eight steps above the public sidewalk from the south side of West 62nd Street east of Columbus Avenue, is flanked by concrete cylinders. Rows of cylinder-shaped concrete planters occupy much of the surface, each with tree but lacking sittable ledges. A wall in back is constructed of rough-ridged concrete. 
<p>In contrast, the remaining plaza space, consisting of a small semicircular drop-off driveway on West 62nd Street closer to Columbus Avenue and extra sidewalk with three planters on the avenue, is primarily surfaced in brick.
