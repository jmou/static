<p>This plain urban plaza at the northeast corner of Eighth Avenue and West 56th Street mixes sun with shade. Its orientation guarantees ample direct sunlight, while the trees growing out of four small granite planters along Eighth Avenue and two larger interior granite planters provide the shade. Users seated on wood benches attached to the planters are obviously satisfied with the dappled light. An open air caf√© is now authorized for the middle of the eastern end of the space.
