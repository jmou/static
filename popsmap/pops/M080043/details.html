<p>In front of this residential tower on the north side of East 87th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues is this sliver of elevated plaza. The space is divided in the middle by a stairwell leading to the front door. To the east is a small vacant landing. Perimeters to the east and west are occupied by long, rectangular planters.
