<p>Demonstrating empirically that steps are sometimes as functional as benches and chairs, the four lining the edge of this tiny urban plaza parallel to the south side of East 59th Street west of Park Avenue are heavily used for improvised seating. That is especially significant here, where the urban plaza was not required to provide traditional seating, furnished the smallest amount of amenities of any urban plaza in the city, and did not generate a floor area bonus. Those seated on the steps can watch pedestrians pass by in the sidewalk widening. An arcade angled under the building at the southwest corner of East 59th Street and Park Avenue offers protection against the elements. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
