<p>The plaza occurs at multiple levels on the three street sides of this full block-front building. On the east side of Third Avenue between East 17th and 18th Streets is a sunken concrete-surfaced strip 12 to 14 steps below the sidewalk dotted with several small planters and trees. Along East 17th Street is a small elevated area five steps up, a terrace in front of the buildingâ€™s primary entrance with numerous concrete planters with ledges too thin or high for sitting. On East 18th Street is an elevated utility area.
