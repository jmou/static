<p>Almost all of the required plaza surrounding the building on the west side of Central Park West and the north side of West 68th Street is covered by planters with trees and attractively arrayed annuals, shrubs, and ground cover. Accessible space is confined largely to the deep, tall arcade lined with hefty metal-clad columns under the buildingâ€™s southeast corner. A canopied entrance corridor flanked with sittable ledges connects the arcade to the public sidewalk from Central Park West. Some of the ledges otherwise sittable have been overtaken by plant growth.
