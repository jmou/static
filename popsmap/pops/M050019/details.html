<p>What used to be little more than extra sidewalk wrapping around the building’s corner at the southeast side of West 56th Street and Sixth Avenue has been pleasantly upgraded into a better plaza. An open air café now activates the corner. Five bright blue chair benches and planters with sculpted trees march up Sixth Avenue. Several benches and planters are placed along East 56th Street. Provided in return for permission to install the café, such small improvements make a big difference in the quality of the space and serve as strong reminders that the public is not forever stuck with the existing condition of “as-of-right” plazas created under the minimal rules of the original 1961 Zoning Resolution. Cleverly retrofitted, marginal spaces can be made to benefit building owner and members of the public alike. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
