<p>The main part of the plaza grips the building on the west side of Washington Street and the south side of Rector Street. The Washington Street portion is an empty space but for three small freestanding planters with trees and a fourth altarlike planter with sittable ledge attached to a southern wall. The Rector Street portion is similarly vacant, except for three flagpoles surrounding a square planter near the corner, two more freestanding planters, and a semicircular planter attached to the wall of an adjacent building that once had a small waterfall and pool.

<p>At a recent site visit, the sliver of plaza on West Street was obstructed by a chain. It, too, is an empty space dotted with several planters.
