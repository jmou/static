<p>The most intriguing aspect of the plaza located on the north side of East 73rd Street east of Second Avenue is its hours. A sign in front of the fenced, deep, rectangular space announces hours of 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. No record of City approval for restricted hours has been found. Furthermore, at a recent site visit, the gates were locked during the very hours specified by the sign, and the sparse landscaping and half-filled garbage bags behind the gates were hardly inviting in any event. 
<p>The remainder of space closer to the host residential building to the north exhibits the two most common “as-of-right” plaza uses at residential buildings: a semicircular drop-off driveway with porte cochere next to the southeast corner of Second Avenue and East 74th Street, and extra sidewalk in front of the commercial frontage bump-out along Second Avenue. The corner is marked with a round planter and sittable ledge, while five more planters marching down Second Avenue have ledges rendered unusable by tiny rail fences. A lone bench is on the sidewalk side of the third planter.
