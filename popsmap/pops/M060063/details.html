<p>Slivers of plaza and arcade on the north side of East 45th Street between First and Second Avenues principally serve the needs of this residential building. The spaces feature a drop-off driveway and pedestrian entrance in the middle, a garage entry/exit to the west, and a service entry to the east. Planter ledges are not made for sitting.
