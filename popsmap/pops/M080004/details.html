<p>The primary space of this residential plaza, located at the back of the building, is a narrow rectangle extending west from the northwest corner of Third Avenue and East 63rd Street. Marking that corner is a large, pergola-like structure with rusticated stone block columns, trellised sides, and open trellis roof. The modest planter at center does not merit the structure that encloses it. A ledge bench occupies the middle of the space to the west, and planters, some on an elevated terrace even further west, are scattered about. With its southern orientation and openness toward the avenue, the space receives plentiful sunlight. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000) 
<p>The area on East 64th Street west of Third Avenue is split into usable and visual residual space. Framed by an arcade, the usable residual space serves as a brick-paved entrance for the building. Its western side is festooned with truncated ornamental classical columns, arrayed on pedestals, and embraced by the curving planter ledge that is good for sitting. Like mushrooms in the forest, additional classical columns emerge out of the ground of the well-landscaped visual residual space.
