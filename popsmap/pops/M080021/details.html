<p>The entry to this residential plaza, roughly 70 feet east of Second Avenue on the south side of East 65th Street, doubles as the entryway to the residential high-rise, eliminating the question whether building residents and members of the public will see each other and coexist. The central corridor is defined by a minimalist purple column-beam structure bearing a glass canopy. Flanking the corridor are angled brick ledges perfectly sized and positioned for sitting. 
<p>Where the canopy doglegs to the front door, the remainder of residential plaza extends forward. Immediately ahead is a delicate waterfall and a rounded shallow pool decorated with a naturalistic abstract stone sculpture and surrounded by a metal rail. Further south is a small area bordered to the east and south by a skillful melange of trees, shrubs, and groundcover, limned with more zigzags of sittable brick ledges. A wall of translucent glass bricks in purple frame marks the rear.
