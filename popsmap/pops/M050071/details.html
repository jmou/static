<p>Around the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and West 16th Street is this tiny residential plaza. Two wooden benches nestled into the planter on West 16th Street employ metal dividers to create 15 seating slots and prevent slouching or sleeping. Adjacent ledges are lined with spiked rails. The Fifth Avenue portion of the space is extra sidewalk.
