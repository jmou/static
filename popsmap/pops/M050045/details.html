<p>This plaza fully surrounds the building on its street sides, along East 48th Street, the west side of Park Avenue, and East 49th Street. On Park Avenue, the space is bordered along the sidewalk by planters with trees, interrupted mid-block by six steps leading to an elevated, empty strip of space. The only usable portion is on East 48th Street, where southern exposure and granite-and-concrete seating ledges combine to attract sun worshipers. Bike racks are provided on both side streets.

<p>The building has a nonrequired through block arcade and covered driveway running under its middle that links East 48th and 49th Streets. The other arcades at the building are similarly nonrequired. Visible to the south across East 48th Street is the dramatic International Style floating-glass lobby of 270 Park Avenue. Its through block arcade combines with the one here to create a two-block covered extension of Vanderbilt Avenue.
