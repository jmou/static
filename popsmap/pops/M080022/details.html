<p>This small plaza on the north side of East 72nd Street between First and Second Avenues is mostly covered by brick landscaped planters and ledges suited to leaning rather than sitting. A sliver of space also creeps around the west face of the building. A smaller arcade is behind the plaza in front of the lobby entrance.
