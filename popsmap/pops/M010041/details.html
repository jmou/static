<p>Under provisions of the now repealed Special Manhattan Landing Development District, this building provided a two-story-high special permit arcade, scooped out from under the collision of rectilinear and curvilinear building elements along the southeast side of Water Street between Fletcher and John Streets. This large covered space is punctuated by massive concrete columns and has retail frontage required by the special permit. Fragments of open pedestrian area flank the arcade at both corners of the lot along Water Street. The tree grouping, tables, and chairs near the intersection of John and Front Streets are not part of the public space.
