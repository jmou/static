<p>The plaza and arcade front the entrances to the office building on the northeast side of Wall Street between Water and Front Streets. Owing to the street alignment and the placement of the office tower on its lot, the plaza slightly expands in size from its southeast to northwest ends. Two flagpoles provide the plaza’s only vertical elements. The full-block arcade may be understood as part of a one-and-a-half block arcade circulation network that includes 110 Wall Street to the southeast. Although not part of the public space, the lobby of 100 Wall Street features a sculpture by Harold Castor that depicts historical episodes and buildings, including General Washington’s entrance into New York City, and Trinity Church. The nonstreet side of the building to the northeast includes more plaza space that merges indistinguishably into the pleasant special permit plaza belonging to 88 Pine Street. Photo: Kayden et al.
