<p>This plaza on the north side of West 58th Street at the back of the Park Lane Hotel is occupied by part of a semicircular drop-off driveway and canopied entrance corridor, as well as two planters. Interestingly, the arcade is partially underneath a projecting roof rather than the building itself, making it one of the more unusual arcade spaces in the city. The through-block space north of the arcade that connects to Central Park South is not part of the public space. Photo: Kayden et al. (2000)
