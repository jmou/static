<p>Recently renovated, this slightly elevated plaza on the east side of Lexington Avenue and the north side of East 36th Street is a visually elegant terrace wrapping around the building. The granite retaining walls along the public sidewalk are courtly, the railing on the ledge refined. The entry to the building, under a green canopy that bisects the terrace, has been well served.
